                    <p>When I began this project, I got a lot of information from the stakeholders. They had already conducted user research sessions, and they had a problem statement in mind. They were looking for me to create a feature that would allow users to monitor progress through the Your Tomorrow digital upskilling program within myMetrics. The stakeholders also put together a mockup of their own, which they provided me with to illustrate their ideas. The problem statement looked something like this:</p>

                    <p>I spent a lot of time in the defining phase trying to figure out how best to work with the data visualizations for this project. I needed to capture a points score, a level name, relative rankings, instructions for getting to the next level, and more. I ended up having to write out all of the user stories I was trying to capture so that I could see all of the specifications in one place:</p>
